## LaTeX

`tex` contains the LaTeX for creating this document. `main.tex` is the sole TeX file for the guide. All images are in `img`, and many are generated from `astrobee_guide_palette.svg`.

Note that the markdown package is used (so that markdown
can be used within LaTeX), see [here](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/generic/markdown/markdown.html).
